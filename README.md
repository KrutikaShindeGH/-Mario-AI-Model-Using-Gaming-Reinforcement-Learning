# -Mario-AI-Model-Using-Gaming-Reinforcement-Learning
The Mario AI Model project harnesses the power of reinforcement learning, employing the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm to train an intelligent agent within the Mario video game environment. To optimize performance, innovative techniques such as greyscaling and vectorization are implemented.
